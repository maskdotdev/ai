- **What to Learn:**
    - Definition of vectors (geometrical and algebraic perspectives)
    - Vector operations: addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, and cross product
    - Vector norms (magnitude/length): L1, L2 norms
    - Basis vectors and the concept of a **vector space**
    - Linear combinations and span of vectors
	
- **Why It's Important:**
    - In machine learning, data points are often represented as vectors.
    - The dot product and norms are used in distance-based models (e.g., **k-NN**, **SVMs**, etc.).

## Geometrical Perspective
A vector is a line segment with both magnitude and direction.

We can think of a vector as an arrow where it's tail sits at the origin of a plane, and points to either 0 or any give scalar. 

### Characteristics 

* Usually represented by an arrow
* The length of the arrow represents the magnitude
* The orientation of the arrow represents the direction
* Commonly denoted by letters with a tilde above $$ \tilde{v}$$

### Examples

* In 2D space a vector can represent a displacement from point A to point B
* Moving 3 units East and 1 unit North as the example above shows

## Algebraic Perspective

A vector is an order list of numbers that describes its components in various axes in space.

2D Vector simply means there's two numbers
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
{3} \\
{1} \\
\end{bmatrix}

\mathbf{v =} 
\begin{pmatrix}
v_{3}, 
v_{1}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Similarly 3D Vector means there's three numbers

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
{3} \\
{1} \\
{2}
\end{bmatrix}


\mathbf{v =} 
\begin{pmatrix}

v_{3}, 
v_{1},
v_{2}

\end{pmatrix}

$$

### Characteristics
* Each component represents how much a vector moves along an axis.
* Vectors in higher dimensions are generalizations
$$
(\mathbb{R}^n), 
\mathbf{v =} 
\begin{pmatrix}

v_{1}, 
v_{2},
\dots,
v_{n}

\end{pmatrix}
$$

### Vector Notation
$$

\mathbf{v =} 
\begin{pmatrix}
v_{1}, 
v_{2},
\dots,
v_{n}
\end{pmatrix}

\mathbf{v =} 
\begin{bmatrix}
{3} \\
{1} \\
{2}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Vector Operations

### Addition
The sum of two vectors is a vector obtained from adding their corresponding components

- *Geometrical* - Place the _tail_ of the second vector at the _head_ of the first vector. The sum vector points from the _tail_ of the firs vector to the _head_ of the second vector

- _Algebraic Formula_  
$$ 
u+v=(ux​+vx​,uy​+vy​,uz​+vz​) \\
$$
$$

\mathbf{u} = (1, 2, 3) \\
\mathbf{v} = (4, 5, 6)
$$
$$
u+v= (1 + 4, 2 + 5, 3+6) = (5, 7, 9)
$$

### Scalar Multiplication
Multiplying a vector by a scalar (number) scales the magnitude of the vector in its direction, multiplying by a negative number would scale to the opposite direction.

- _Algebraic Formula_
$$
c \cdot v = (c \cdot v_{x}, c \cdot v_{y}, c \cdot v_{z})
$$
$$\text{Where } c \text{ is the scalar and } v = (v_{x}, v_{y}, v_{z}) $$
